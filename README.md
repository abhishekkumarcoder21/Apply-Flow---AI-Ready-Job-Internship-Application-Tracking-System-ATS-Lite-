# 🚀 ApplyFlow

### AI-Ready Job & Internship Application Tracking System (ATS-Lite)

ApplyFlow is a **modern, full-stack, SaaS-style personal Applicant Tracking System** designed to help developers and students **track job and internship applications professionally** — similar to how companies manage candidates internally.

This project focuses on **real-world workflows, clean architecture, and future-ready design**, not just CRUD operations.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

During job and internship preparation, applications are usually:

* Scattered across LinkedIn, company career pages, and referrals
* Hard to track and follow up
* Difficult to analyze (what’s working, what’s not)

Most people use Excel or notes — which **does not scale**.

---

## 💡 Solution

**ApplyFlow** provides a **centralized system** where users can:

* Track every application
* Monitor progress through different stages
* Visualize application data via a clean dashboard
* Plan follow-ups intelligently

Built with a **product mindset**, not as a demo app.
